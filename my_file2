In that case, you can use the pandas library to read the Excel file and handle the tables with similar headers. Here's an updated version of the code:
Python
import pandas as pd

def handle_tables(excel_path):
    # Read the Excel file
    excel_file = pd.ExcelFile(excel_path)

    # Iterate over the sheets
    for sheet_name in excel_file.sheet_names:
        if sheet_name.startswith("Table_"):
            # Read the sheet into a DataFrame
            df = excel_file.parse(sheet_name)

            # Check if the header is similar to the previous header
            if 'prev_header' in locals() and all(cell in prev_header for cell in df.columns):
                # Reuse the previous header
                df.columns = prev_header
            else:
                # Update the previous header
                prev_header = df.columns.tolist()

            # Save the updated DataFrame to a new Excel file
            df.to_excel("updated_" + excel_path, sheet_name=sheet_name, index=False)

# Usage
excel_path = "your_file.xlsx"
handle_tables(excel_path)
This code reads the Excel file, iterates over the sheets, and checks if the header of each table is similar to the previous header. If it is, it reuses the previous header. Otherwise, it updates the previous header. Finally, it saves the updated DataFrames to a new Excel file.
