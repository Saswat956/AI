How to run this file and create steps for each task with dummy data
Answer
To run the FastAPI application and create steps for each task with dummy data, follow these steps:
Save the code in a file (e.g., main.py).
Install the required dependencies:
bash
pip install fastapi sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary uvicorn

Set up your PostgreSQL database:
Create a database named fastapi_db (or use an existing one).
Create a schema named policy_repository (if it doesn't exist).
Update the DATABASE_URL in the code with your PostgreSQL credentials:
python
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://username:password@localhost/fastapi_db"

Run the FastAPI application:
bash
uvicorn main:app --reload

Create dummy data for testing:
Use a tool like Postman or curl to send POST requests to http://127.0.0.1:8000/policy_business_rules/ with dummy data.
Example dummy data:
json
{
  "policy_id": 1,
  "standard_id": 101,
  "rule_desc": "Dummy rule description",
  "rule_definition": "Dummy rule definition",
  "status": "Active",
  "created_by_user_id": "user123",
  "lst_updt_by_user_id": "user123"
}

Test the other endpoints:
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/policy_business_rules/ to retrieve all rules.
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/policy_business_rules/1 to retrieve a specific rule by ID (replace 1 with the actual ID).
PUT http://127.0.0.1:8000/policy_business_rules/1 to update a rule by ID (replace 1 with the actual ID).
DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/policy_business_rules/1 to delete a rule by ID (replace 1 with the actual ID).
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/policy_business_rules/count to get the total count of rules.
Here's a step-by-step guide for each task:
Create a New Policy Business Rule
Send a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:8000/policy_business_rules/ with the following JSON data:
json
{
  "policy_id": 1,
  "standard_id": 101,
  "rule_desc": "Dummy rule description",
  "rule_definition": "Dummy rule definition",
  "status": "Active",
  "created_by_user_id": "user123",
  "lst_updt_by_user_id": "user123"
}

The API will create a new policy business rule and return the created rule with the assigned br_rule_id.
Retrieve All Policy Business Rules
Send a GET request to http://127.0.0.1:8000/policy_business_rules/.
The API will return a list of all policy business rules, with a default limit of 10 rules per request.
You can use query parameters skip and limit to paginate the results, e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8000/policy_business_rules/?skip=10&limit=10.
Retrieve a Specific Policy Business Rule
Send a GET request to http://127.0.0.1:8000/policy_business_rules/1, replacing 1 with the actual br_rule_id of the rule you want to retrieve.
The API will return the details of the specified policy business rule.
Update a Policy Business Rule
Send a PUT request to http://127.0.0.1:8000/policy_business_rules/1, replacing 1 with the actual br_rule_id of the rule you want to update.
Include the updated data in the request body as JSON, e.g.:
json
{
  "policy_id": 2,
  "standard_id": 102,
  "rule_desc": "Updated rule description",
  "rule_definition": "Updated rule definition",
  "status": "Inactive",
  "created_by_user_id": "user123",
  "lst_updt_by_user_id": "user456"
}

The API will update the specified policy business rule and return the updated rule details.
Delete a Policy Business Rule
Send a DELETE request to http://127.0.0.1:8000/policy_business_rules/1, replacing 1 with the actual br_rule_id of the rule you want to delete.
The API will delete the specified policy business rule and return a success message.
Get the Count of Policy Business Rules
Send a GET request to http://127.0.0.1:8000/policy_business_rules/count.
The API will return the total count of policy business rules in the database.
By following these steps and using the provided dummy data, you can test the functionality of your FastAPI application for managing policy business rules.
